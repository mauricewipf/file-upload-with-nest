# File Upload with Nest

## Description

A showcase how to upload files with **Nest Framework**.

Nest comes with [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) under the hood for file uploading. 
There is a section about [File upload in the Nest documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/file-upload). 

## Configuration

The configuration happens in `multerOptions`.

In the project the following options are used:

- File size limit
- Check mimetype
- Storage destination is `files/` folder
- The original file name is overwritten with a `uuid`
- More options are available. See [multer documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer#multeropts).
